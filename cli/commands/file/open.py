    Search by filters and try to open already

    Available filters:\b
        scope: Define a path as search scope
               -----------------------------
               The *scope* is an absolute directory in which
               we will search your file by other filters. By
               default, the tgbox.api.utils.search_generator
               will search over the entire LocalBox. This can
               be slow if you're have too many files.
               \b
               Example: let's imagine that You're a Linux user which
               share it's Box with the Windows user. In this case,
               Your LocalBox will contain a path parts on the
               '/' (Linux) and 'C:\\' (Windows) roots. If You
               know that some file was uploaded by Your friend,
               then You can specify a scope='C:\\' to ignore
               all files uploaded from the Linux machine. This
               will significantly fasten the search process,
               because almost all filters require to select
               row from the LocalBox DB, decrypt Metadata and
               compare its values with ones from SearchFilter.
               \b
               !: The scope will be ignored on RemoteBox search.
               !: The min_id & max_id will be ignored if scope used.

        id integer: Fileâ€™s ID

        max_id integer: File ID should be < max_id
        \b
        min_size integer/str: File Size should be > min_size
        max_size integer/str: File Size should be < max_size
        +
        min_size & max_size can be also specified as string,
            i.e "1GB" (one gigabyte), "122.45KB" or "700B"
        \b
        min_time integer/float/str: Upload Time should be > min_time
        max_time integer/float/str: Upload Time should be < max_time
        +
        min_time & max_time can be also specified as string,
            i.e "22/02/22, 22:22:22" or "22/02/22"
               ("%d/%m/%y, %H:%M:%S" or "%d/%m/%y")
        \b
        minor_version int: File minor version
        imported bool: Yield only imported files
        re       bool: Regex search for every str filter
        \b
